# NEAR Oracle Protocol Security Testing Framework

Comprehensive security testing framework for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the security posture of the NEAR Oracle Intent Protocol.

## Overview

This framework provides automated security testing for:
- **Access Control**: Role-based authorization and privilege escalation prevention
- **Input Validation**: Malicious input handling and sanitization
- **Data Integrity**: Storage consistency and data corruption prevention  
- **Attack Prevention**: Reentrancy, front-running, timing attacks
- **Resource Protection**: Gas exhaustion and storage overflow prevention
- **Authentication**: Unauthorized access and session management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **NEAR environment set up**
   ```bash
   npm install -g near-cli
   near login  # For testnet testing
   ```

2. **Contract built** (for sandbox testing)
   ```bash
   cd contracts/oracle-intent
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

3. **Dependencies installed**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Security Tests

#### Basic Security Audit
```bash
npm run test:security
```

#### Verbose Security Assessment  
```bash
npm run test:security:verbose
```

#### Complete Security Audit
```bash
npm run audit:security
```

#### Custom Configuration
```bash
npm run test:security -- --contract oracle.testnet --output ./audit-reports --verbose
```

## Security Test Categories

### 1. Access Control Testing
**Purpose**: Verify proper authorization and role-based access control

**Tests Include**:
- Unauthorized admin function access attempts
- Role escalation prevention (user ‚Üí admin)
- Cross-user data access restrictions
- Function-level authorization checks

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Users self-assigning admin roles
- Cross-user private data access
- Unprotected administrative functions

### 2. Input Validation Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized

**Tests Include**:
- Invalid confidence thresholds (negative, >1.0, NaN)
- Excessive parameter values (sources, deadlines)
- String length limits and buffer overflow prevention
- Special character and injection attempt handling

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Acceptance of negative confidence scores
- Unlimited input string lengths
- Unescaped special characters in storage

### 3. Reentrancy Protection Testing
**Purpose**: Verify protection against reentrancy attacks and race conditions

**Tests Include**:
- Rapid successive call handling
- State consistency during concurrent operations
- External call callback protection
- Atomic operation verification

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Race conditions in state updates
- Inconsistent storage during rapid calls
- Unprotected external interactions

### 4. Data Integrity Testing  
**Purpose**: Ensure data consistency and prevent corruption

**Tests Include**:
- Storage/retrieval data matching
- Multi-operation consistency checks
- Data type preservation verification
- Concurrent access data integrity

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Data corruption during storage
- Inconsistent state across operations
- Type conversion errors

### 5. Privilege Escalation Testing
**Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized privilege increases

**Tests Include**:
- Direct role assignment attempts
- Indirect privilege escalation paths
- Permission boundary violations
- Administrative function protection

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Direct admin role self-assignment
- Privilege escalation through helper functions
- Unprotected role modification functions

### 6. Attack Vector Testing
**Purpose**: Test resistance to common blockchain attacks

**Tests Include**:
- Front-running protection (duplicate intent detection)
- Timing attack resistance (constant-time operations)
- Gas exhaustion prevention (operation limits)
- Storage exhaustion protection (usage limits)

**Example Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- Predictable operation timing
- Unlimited gas consumption paths
- Storage space exhaustion vectors

## Security Report Generation

| 71-100 | üö® High Risk | Critical remediation required |

### Vulnerability Severity Definitions

#### Critical (Score: 25 each)
- Direct fund loss potential
- Complete system compromise
- Unauthorized admin access
- Data manipulation capabilities

#### High (Score: 15 each)
- Privilege escalation vectors  
- Authentication bypasses
- Data integrity violations
- Service disruption potential

#### Medium (Score: 8 each)
- Information disclosure
- Input validation gaps
- Rate limiting bypasses

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Security Checks

```bash
# Add to git hooks or CI/CD
npm run test:security
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Security tests failed - commit blocked"
  exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
name: Security Testing

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build contract
        run: |
          cd contracts/oracle-intent
          cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
      
      - name: Run security tests
        run: npm run audit:security
      
      - name: Upload security reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: security-reports
          path: security-reports/
      
      - name: Check for critical vulnerabilities
        run: |
          if grep -q '"critical":[1-9]' security-reports/*.json; then
            echo "Critical vulnerabilities detected!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Testnet Security Validation

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# Run security tests against testnet contract
npm run test:security -- \
  --contract oracle-intent.nearacles.testnet \
  --verbose \
  --output ./testnet-security-reports
```

## Advanced Security Testing

### Custom Vulnerability Tests

Extend the framework with custom tests:

```typescript
// Add to SecurityTestSuite class
private async testCustomVulnerability(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('üîç Testing custom vulnerability...');
  
  const findings: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  try {
    // Custom test logic here
    
    this.addResult({
      testName: 'Custom Vulnerability Test',
      passed: findings.length === 0,
      severity: 'medium',
      description: 'Custom security test description',
      findings,
      recommendations
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle test errors
  }
}
```

### Security Test Automation

```bash
# Schedule regular security scans
0 2 * * * /path/to/project && npm run audit:security

# Integrate with monitoring
npm run test:security --output /var/log/security/ --no-report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Contract Deployment Failures
```
Error: Contract deployment failed
```
**Solutions**: 
- Verify contract builds successfully
- Check NEAR account balance
- Validate network connectivity

#### Test Environment Setup Errors
```
Error: Failed to create test accounts
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure near-workspaces dependency is installed
- Verify sufficient test account funds
- Check sandbox initialization

#### Permission Denied Errors
```
Error: Unauthorized access to contract function
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify contract is properly initialized
- Check account registrations
- Validate test account setup

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for detailed analysis:

```bash
npm run test:security:verbose
```

This provides:
- Individual test step details
- Contract interaction logs
- Error stack traces
- Timing information
- State change tracking
