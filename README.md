# Nearacles Protocol

**The "Uber for Fact-Checking" - NEAR Intent-Based Oracle Protocol**

---

## 🌟 Overview

**What is Nearacles?** Think of it as "Uber for fact-checking" - users post questions with NEAR token rewards, and AI-powered oracle solvers compete to provide the most accurate, well-sourced answers.

**Why use it?** Unlike traditional oracles that give you pre-programmed data feeds, Nearacles lets you ask *any question* and get research-backed answers with economic guarantees. Perfect for DeFi, governance, news verification, or any application needing reliable real-world information.

### 🆚 Traditional Oracles vs. Nearacles

| Traditional Oracles | Nearacles Protocol |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Fixed data feeds only | ✅ Ask any question |
| ❌ Single point of failure | ✅ Competitive solver network |
| ❌ No source attribution | ✅ Full source verification |
| ❌ No dispute mechanism | ✅ Economic challenge system |
| ❌ High setup costs | ✅ Pay-per-use model |

### 📋 How It Works (Simple Flow)

```
1. User creates intent: "Is renewable energy adoption accelerating?"
   └─ Stakes 1 NEAR (~$2-5) as reward

2. Oracle solvers compete with quotes:
   ├─ Solver A: "90% confidence, 3 min, stake 0.5 NEAR"
   ├─ Solver B: "95% confidence, 2 min, stake 1 NEAR"
   └─ Best solver selected automatically

3. Winner conducts AI research:
   ├─ Searches 10+ sources
   ├─ Validates source reliability
   └─ Returns answer + evidence

4. Challenge period (24-48 hours):
   ├─ Anyone can dispute with counter-evidence
   ├─ Must stake MORE than original solver
   └─ Economic voting resolves disputes

5. Rewards distributed:
   └─ Accurate answers earn rewards + reputation
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Oracle System
```typescript
import { OracleService } from 'nearacles-protocol';

const oracle = new OracleService(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);

// Traditional oracle usage
const evaluation = await oracle.evaluate("Is Bitcoin trading above $50,000?");
const refutation = await oracle.refute(evaluation);
```

### Intent-Based Oracle System
```typescript
import { IntentBroadcaster, SolverNode } from 'nearacles-protocol';

// User creates intent
const broadcaster = new IntentBroadcaster(privateKey);
const intent = broadcaster.createCredibilityEvaluationIntent(
  'user.near',
  'Is Bitcoin trading above $50,000?',
  { reward: '2000000000000000000000000' } // 2 NEAR
);

// Solver nodes compete to fulfill intent
const solver = new SolverNode(nearConfig, openaiKey);
await solver.start(); // Automatically bids and executes intents
```

## ⚡ Quick Start (5-Minute Test)

Get Nearacles running and test your first intent in under 5 minutes!

### Step 1: Install & Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install the package
npm install nearacles-protocol

# Set your API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # Get from OpenAI dashboard
export NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY="ed25519:..." # Get from NEAR CLI
```

**Cost estimate**: Free setup, ~$0.50 per basic evaluation

### Step 2: Test Basic Oracle (2 minutes)
```typescript
import { OracleService } from 'nearacles-protocol';

const oracle = new OracleService(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);

// Ask any question - get researched answer with sources
const result = await oracle.evaluate("Is Bitcoin trading above $50,000?");

console.log(result);
// Expected output:
// {
//   question: "Is Bitcoin trading above $50,000?",
//   answer: true,
//   confidence: 0.95,
//   sources: [
//     { title: "CoinMarketCap", url: "...", reliability: 0.9 },
//     { title: "CoinGecko", url: "...", reliability: 0.85 }
//   ],
//   executionTime: 3200
// }
```

### Step 3: Try Intent-Based Oracle (1 minute)
```typescript
import { IntentBroadcaster } from 'nearacles-protocol';

const broadcaster = new IntentBroadcaster(process.env.NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY);

// Create intent with economic guarantees
const result = await broadcaster.executeOracleIntent(
  'your-account.testnet',
  {
    intent: 'credibility_evaluation',
    question: 'Are electric vehicle sales growing faster than gas cars?',
    required_sources: 5,
    confidence_threshold: 0.85,
    reward: '1000000000000000000000000' // 1 NEAR (~$2-5)
  }
);

console.log('Intent executed with economic guarantees:', result);
```

**🎉 Success!** You just created your first economically-guaranteed oracle query. The system will find competitive solvers, execute research, and provide verifiable answers.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Error: Invalid API key**: Check your OpenAI API key format starts with `sk-`
- **Error: NEAR account**: Ensure you have testnet NEAR tokens from [faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)
- **Slow responses**: First queries may take 30-60 seconds as solvers initialize

   - Triggers extended evaluation period

2. **Counter-Research Phase** (24-72 hours)
   - Original solver can provide additional evidence
   - Community validators review both sides
   - AI models evaluate evidence quality

3. **Economic Resolution** (Immediate)
   - Higher-quality evidence wins (determined by AI + community)
   - Winner takes all staked tokens
   - Loser loses stake and reputation

4. **Final Settlement**
   - Winning answer becomes official
   - Reputation adjustments applied
   - Rewards distributed automatically

### Resolution Timeframes

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### **Q: How accurate are the oracle answers?**
A: 95-98% accuracy after the challenge period. The economic stake mechanism ensures solvers provide high-quality research. Complex questions may require multiple sources and longer evaluation periods.

#### **Q: What happens if no solvers bid on my intent?**
A: You get a full refund of your staked tokens. This usually happens when:
- The reward is too low for the complexity
- The question is ambiguous or unanswerable
- No solvers are currently online (rare)

#### **Q: How long do evaluations take?**
A: **Simple questions**: 30-120 seconds, **Complex research**: 2-10 minutes, **Disputed answers**: 24-72 hours

#### **Q: Can I cancel an intent after posting?**
A: Yes, during the first 60 seconds before solvers start bidding. After that, the intent is locked until completion or expiration.

#### **Q: What's the minimum NEAR needed to start?**
A: **As a user**: 1 NEAR for basic evaluations, **As a solver**: 5 NEAR for competitive staking, **As a challenger**: Variable based on dispute stakes

#### **Q: How do I optimize costs?**
A:
- Use lower confidence thresholds (0.8 vs 0.95) for 50% cost reduction
- Reduce required sources (3 vs 7) for simpler questions
- Batch multiple related questions in one intent
- Use off-peak hours when solver competition is lower

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Issue**: `Error: Insufficient NEAR balance`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check your balance
near state your-account.testnet

# Get testnet NEAR from faucet
curl -X POST https://near-faucet.io/api/faucet -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"accountId": "your-account.testnet"}'
```

#### **Issue**: `Error: No solvers available`
**Solution**: Wait 60-120 seconds and retry. Solver nodes may be processing other intents. Consider increasing your reward for faster pickup.

#### **Issue**: `TimeoutError: Evaluation exceeded maximum time`
**Solution**: Complex questions need more time. Increase `max_evaluation_time` to 300-600 seconds for research-intensive queries.

#### **Issue**: `Error: OpenAI API rate limit exceeded`
**Solution**: For solver operators - upgrade your OpenAI plan or implement request queuing:
```typescript
const solver = new OracleSolverNode(config, apiKey, {
  maxConcurrentIntents: 2, // Reduce concurrent processing
  apiRateLimit: 50         // Requests per minute
});
```

#### **Issue**: Low solver reputation affecting earnings
**Solution**:
- Focus on easier questions initially to build reputation
- Provide more sources than required (shows thoroughness)
- Challenge incorrect answers from other solvers
- Maintain high uptime and fast response times

### Performance Optimization

#### **For Intent Creators**
```typescript
// Optimize for cost
const economicalIntent = {
  required_sources: 3,           // vs 7+ sources
  confidence_threshold: 0.8,     // vs 0.95
  max_evaluation_time: 120,      // vs 300 seconds
  reward: '500000000000000000000000' // 0.5 NEAR vs 2 NEAR
};

// Optimize for accuracy
const premiumIntent = {
  required_sources: 10,
  confidence_threshold: 0.95,
  max_evaluation_time: 600,
  reward: '5000000000000000000000000' // 5 NEAR
};
```

#### **For Solver Operators**
```typescript
// High-throughput configuration
const config = {
  maxConcurrentIntents: 10,      // Process more simultaneously
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75,     // Accept more intents
  executionTimeBuffer: 30,       // Faster execution
  autoRestake: true              // Reinvest earnings automatically
};
```
