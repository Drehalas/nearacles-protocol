## How She Uses Nearacles

### Discovery Phase
- Learns about identity verification oracles through DeFi Twitter and conferences
- Evaluates documentation for developer-friendly integration
- Tests identity verification flow with small user group
- Analyzes impact on user conversion and engagement metrics

### Integration Planning
- Works with engineering team to design identity verification UX
- Creates product specifications for Sybil-resistant governance
- Plans rollout strategy with gradual feature activation
- Designs user education materials and onboarding flows

### Production Usage
- Monitors identity verification conversion rates and user feedback
- Tracks governance participation improvements through Dashboard
- Uses Analytics to optimize identity verification UX
- Engages with Nearacles product team for feature requests

### Success Measurement
- Measures governance participation increase (target: +150%)
- Tracks user onboarding conversion improvements (target: +40%)
- Monitors Sybil attack reduction in voting (target: 95% reduction)
- Analyzes user sentiment and community trust metrics

## Representative Quote
> "We need seamless identity verification that doesn't break our user experience. If users can prove their identity in 30 seconds without feeling surveilled, we can solve governance participation and build real community trust."

## Pain Points with Current Solutions
- **Manual verification:** Too slow and breaks user flow
- **Full KYC providers:** Too invasive for DeFi users
- **On-chain identity:** Limited adoption and trust
- **Custom solutions:** Too expensive and time-intensive to build

## Success Metrics
- **Governance participation rate:** 25%+ of token holders voting
- **Identity verification conversion:** 80%+ completion rate
- **User trust scores:** Net Promoter Score above 50
- **Sybil attack prevention:** 95%+ reduction in fake votes
- **Feature adoption:** 60%+ of active users using identity features

## Decision-Making Process
1. **User research** (surveys, interviews, usage data)
2. **Competitive analysis** (feature comparison, market gaps)
3. **Technical feasibility** (engineering capacity, integration complexity)
4. **Business impact modeling** (TVL growth, user acquisition)
5. **Regulatory risk assessment** (compliance requirements)
6. **DAO governance proposal** (community vote on major features)

## Stakeholder Management
- **Reports to:** Protocol CEO/Founder
- **Collaborates with:** Engineering, Marketing, Community, Legal
- **Presents to:** DAO governance, investor updates, community calls
- **Influences:** Product roadmap, user experience, governance features

## Customer Examples
- **Ref Finance:** Leading NEAR AMM with governance token and DAO
- **Uniswap:** Original inspiration, governance participation challenges
- **SushiSwap:** Community-driven governance and product decisions
- **Curve Finance:** Vote-escrowed tokenomics and governance voting
