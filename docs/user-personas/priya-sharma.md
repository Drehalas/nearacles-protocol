## How She Uses Nearacles

### Strategy Development
- Uses real-time oracle data for automated vault rebalancing decisions
- Backtests yield strategies using historical oracle price feeds
- Implements cross-chain arbitrage strategies using unified oracle infrastructure
- Develops risk management algorithms based on oracle data quality metrics

### Operations Management
- Monitors oracle performance and latency through executive dashboards
- Sets up alerts for oracle failures that could affect automated strategies
- Optimizes oracle usage to minimize gas costs while maintaining performance
- Tracks oracle ROI impact on overall protocol yield performance

### Strategic Planning
- Uses Analytics to identify new market opportunities and yield sources
- Evaluates oracle coverage for expansion to new assets and chains
- Plans oracle infrastructure scaling for TVL growth projections
- Negotiates enterprise oracle contracts for predictable costs

### Partnership Development
- Collaborates with oracle providers on custom data feed requirements
- Integrates with multiple oracle sources for redundancy and data validation
- Partners with other DeFi protocols requiring similar oracle infrastructure
- Advises other founders on oracle integration best practices

## Representative Quote
> "We need oracles that can feed real-time data to our automated vault strategies. When yield opportunities exist for just minutes, oracle latency is the difference between profit and loss for our users."

## Pain Points with Current Solutions
- **Chainlink:** Reliable but expensive for high-frequency strategies
- **Band Protocol:** Good coverage but limited cross-chain consistency
- **Custom oracles:** Too much infrastructure overhead to maintain
- **Free alternatives:** Unreliable for automated strategies requiring precision

## Success Metrics
- **Protocol TVL growth:** 50%+ quarter-over-quarter growth
- **Strategy outperformance:** 500+ basis points above benchmark yields
- **Oracle uptime:** 99.99%+ availability for automated strategies
- **Cross-chain expansion:** Successfully operating on 5+ blockchain networks
- **User satisfaction:** Net Promoter Score above 60 from yield farmers

## Business Model & Strategy

### Revenue Streams
- **Performance fees:** 20% of yield generated above benchmark
- **Management fees:** 2% annual fee on assets under management
- **Token incentives:** Protocol token rewards for early adopters
- **Partnership revenue:** Revenue sharing with integrated protocols

### Competitive Advantages
- **Automated strategies:** Superior risk-adjusted returns vs manual farming
- **Cross-chain optimization:** Unified yield opportunities across chains
- **Institutional-grade infrastructure:** Reliable enough for large capital
- **Quantitative expertise:** Data-driven strategy development and optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Automated Strategy Engine
- **Real-time rebalancing:** Oracle-driven position adjustments
- **Risk management:** Dynamic position sizing based on market conditions
