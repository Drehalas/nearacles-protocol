# Oracle System Code Improvements Plan

Based on the comprehensive code review, I'll implement the following critical improvements:

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Fixes
1. **Replace hardcoded Bitcoin logic** with configurable answer parsing strategies
2. **Implement custom error types** for better error handling and debugging
3. **Add comprehensive input validation** using schema validation (zod)
4. **Fix refutation logic** to consider source quality, not just quantity

## Phase 2: Type Safety & Reliability  
5. **Enhance OpenAI response validation** with proper type guards
6. **Add Result<T, E> pattern** for robust error handling
7. **Make source reliability configuration** dynamic and updatable
8. **Improve status handling** consistency across all interfaces

## Phase 3: Production Readiness
9. **Add dependency injection** for better testability
10. **Implement caching layer** to reduce API costs
11. **Add structured logging** and performance metrics
12. **Create comprehensive test coverage**

This plan addresses the critical business logic issues, improves type safety, and makes the system more maintainable and production-ready. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a systematic improvement process.

Would you like me to proceed with these improvements?
