## Overview
Implement the off-chain solver network infrastructure to enable real-time communication between intent creators, solvers, and the protocol.

## Requirements

### Solver Bus Service
- [ ] WebSocket server for real-time communication
- [ ] Message routing and broadcasting
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting and DoS protection
- [ ] Monitoring and health checks

### Solver Registration
- [ ] Onboarding process for new solvers
- [ ] KYC/verification workflows
- [ ] Solver capability assessment
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Communication Protocol
- [ ] Message format standardization
- [ ] Intent broadcasting mechanisms
- [ ] Quote submission protocols
- [ ] Status update notifications

## Technical Specifications
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with WebSocket support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for solver data
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack
- **Security**: JWT authentication, TLS encryption

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Solver registration system operational
- [ ] Real-time messaging with <100ms latency
- [ ] Support for 100+ concurrent solvers
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard functional
- [ ] Load testing completed successfully

## Dependencies
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Database setup
- Monitoring stack
