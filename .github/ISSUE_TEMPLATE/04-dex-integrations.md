## Overview
Integrate with major NEAR ecosystem DEXs to provide comprehensive liquidity access and optimal execution for intents.

## Requirements

### DEX Integrations
- [ ] Ref Finance integration
- [ ] Jumbo Exchange integration
- [ ] Trisolaris integration
- [ ] Spin DEX integration
- [ ] Future DEX adapter framework

### Liquidity Aggregation
- [ ] Real-time liquidity monitoring
- [ ] Price discovery across DEXs
- [ ] Arbitrage opportunity detection
- [ ] Optimal routing algorithms
- [ ] Slippage calculation

### Execution Engine
- [ ] Multi-DEX execution coordination
- [ ] Atomic swap mechanisms
- [ ] Partial fill handling
- [ ] MEV protection strategies
- [ ] Gas optimization

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] DEX performance tracking
- [ ] Liquidity depth analysis
- [ ] Fee comparison dashboard
- [ ] Execution quality metrics

## Technical Specifications
- **Smart Contracts**: Multi-DEX router contract
- **APIs**: Integration with DEX APIs and on-chain data
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live price feeds
- **Security**: Slippage protection and MEV resistance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration with at least 3 major NEAR DEXs
- [ ] Liquidity aggregation functional across all DEXs
- [ ] Optimal routing saves >5% on average vs single DEX
- [ ] Sub-second price discovery latency
- [ ] MEV protection mechanisms tested

## Dependencies
