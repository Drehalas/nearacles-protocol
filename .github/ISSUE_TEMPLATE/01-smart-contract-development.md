## Overview
Develop and deploy the core smart contracts for the NEAR Intent Protocol to enable on-chain intent verification, execution coordination, and solver management.

## Requirements

### Verifier Contract
- [ ] Intent submission and validation
- [ ] Quote collection and verification
- [ ] User registration and access control
- [ ] Intent execution coordination
- [ ] Storage optimization and gas efficiency

### Intent Manager Contract  
- [ ] Intent lifecycle management
- [ ] Expiry handling and cleanup
- [ ] Status tracking and events
- [ ] Cross-contract communication

### Solver Registry Contract
- [ ] Solver registration and verification
- [ ] Reputation tracking system
- [ ] Performance metrics storage
- [ ] Reward distribution logic

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: Rust with near-sdk-rs
- **Storage**: Efficient data structures for intents and quotes
- **Gas**: Optimized for minimal gas consumption
- **Security**: Access controls and input validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All contracts compile without warnings
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with NEAR Workspaces
- [ ] Gas optimization analysis completed
- [ ] Security audit preparation documentation

## Dependencies
- near-sdk-rs
- NEAR Workspaces for testing
- Security audit tools
